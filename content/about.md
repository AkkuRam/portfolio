I come from Germany, where I speak the languages: English, German & Kannada. I have completed my bachelor’s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University.

Currently, I am studying the Data Science for Decision Making masters at Maastricht University. In my free time, I enjoy programming and playing chess. The main languages I code in are Python and Rust, however I have experience coding in other languages as well (i.e. Java, MATLAB, R, Golang).
