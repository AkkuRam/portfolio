## 📚 Projects

### **Spectroscopy - Plastic Type Prediction (Group)**
- The goal was to classify different household plastic types using spectral data
- This project was done in Python, where the spectral data ranged from 700nm-1000nm and categorical columns (color, transparency) were taken into account
- Contributions
    - Preprocessing: Oversampling, Baseline Correction, Normalization, and Savitzky-Golay filter
    - Algorithms: High-level fusion (i.e. Bayesian Consensus) and Mid-level fusion (i.e. PCA + Models (XGBoost, AdaBoost, MLP, RF)

### **Bachelor Thesis - Type II Diabetes Prediction**

- This project was done in Python, using the NHANES dataset (28061 instances, 19 features)
- The main objective was to accurately predict whether a patient has Type II diabetes
- Contributions:
    - EDA, Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Model (Predictions, Evaluation, Hypertuning) \& Explainability (LIME \& Shapley)
    - Algorithms: AdaBoost, XGBoost \& MLP
